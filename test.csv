It still stings that he was able to retain his seat. If he's going to harass and obstruct Biden's election win, I can't even imagine what kind of a pain he'll be once Biden is sworn in.

&gt;And when Donald Trump started taking over the Republican Party, few GOP officials were as outspoken in their denunciations of the television personality as South Carolina's senior senator.  
&gt;  
&gt;But after the 2016 race, Graham became a fundamentally different kind of politician. Many assumed it was the inevitable result of his self-preservation instincts: Graham saw the writing on the wall and realized that he had to move sharply to the right to protect his career. The hope in some circles was that the senator would move back toward the mainstream once he'd won re-election and Trump was defeated.

Well, there was also that private meeting he had with Trump at one of his golf courses that ushered in the ""new"" Lindsey Graham. FFS people, stop voting for Graham, Collins, McConnell, and others!

Edit: found it.

&gt;	Former GOP strategist Steve Schmidt to Rolling Stone:

&gt;	People try to analyze Lindsey through the prism of the manifest inconsistencies that exist between things that he used to believe and what he’s doing now. The way to understand him is to look at what’s consistent. And essentially what he is in American politics is what, in the aquatic world, would be a pilot fish: a smaller fish that hovers about a larger predator, like a shark, living off of its detritus. That’s Lindsey. And when he swam around the McCain shark, broadly viewed as a virtuous and good shark, Lindsey took on the patina of virtue. But wherever the apex shark is, you find the Lindsey fish hovering about, and Trump’s the newest shark in the sea. Lindsey has a real draw to power — but he’s found it unattainable on his own merits.
